Linked List Data Structure
Recent Articles on Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:


In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
